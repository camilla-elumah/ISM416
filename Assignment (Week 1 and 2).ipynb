    "Natural Language Processing is very much linked with machine learning.It is a branch of computer science that deals with giving computers the ability to understand text and verbal language as naturally as human beings can. Natuaral Language Processing is a combination of computational linguistics with statistical machine learning and deep learning models. Several applications  of Natural Language Processing include speech recognition, word disambiguation, sentiment analysis and natural language generation. The main aim of NLP is to identify, compare, comprehend and make sense of the human languages in such a way that it adds value. It is a technology used to assist computers to understand the natural languages that human beings speak or write down. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some uses of Natural Language Processing include; It helps the computers to understant texts, interpret speech and to measure sentiments.\n",
    "It is also used for structuring unstructured dataand it helps settle ambiguity in  the diversity of human languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language processing works by applying algorithms to know and extract the natural language rules in order to convert it into data that the computer understands. techniques used in natural language processing include syntactic analysis and semantic analysis. Syntactical analysis connotes the arrangement of words, characters and letters in such a manner that they make grammatical sense. Semantic ananlysis deals with the application of computer algorithms to generate the meaning of words and how natural sentences are structured.\n"
